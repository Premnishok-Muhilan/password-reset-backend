How jwt.verify Works

Token Structure:
  JWTs are structured into three parts:
      Header: Contains metadata about the token (e.g., the algorithm used for signing).
      Payload: Contains the claims or data, such as user ID and token expiration.
      Signature: A cryptographic signature created using the header and payload, and the secret key.

  When you call jwt.verify(token, JWT_SECRET), the following happens:

    Decode the Token: The method decodes the JWT into its three components: header, payload, and signature.
    
    Check Signature: It then verifies the signature using the JWT_SECRET. This involves re-generating the 
    signature based on the header and payload, and comparing it with the signature part of the token. 
    If they match, the token is considered authentic. 
    
    Validate Claims: The method checks the claims in the payload, such as expiration (exp), issued at (iat),
    and other custom claims, if present.If any claims are invalid (e.g., the token is expired), the method
    will throw an error.
    
    Return Decoded Payload: If the token is valid and the signature matches, jwt.verify returns the decoded
    payload (i.e., the data encoded in the token)


    // Verify and decode the token
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, JWT_SECRET);
    console.log(decoded);
    // Output: { sub: '1234567890', name: 'John Doe', iat: 1516239024 }
